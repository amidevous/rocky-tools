violation of international laws on freedom of expression

disrespect to everyone
they close the exits without any resolution
and when we insist with them that we keep an open issue
they block the user in question
which represents a violation of international laws on freedom of expression
I invite everyone who wants it and is concerned to join me
to prosecute them against this offense before international courts
